# Objective:
# The aim of this assignment is to reinforce your understanding and application of Python dictionaries, nested collections, and dictionary methods in real-world scenarios. You will apply these concepts to solve practical problems, demonstrating your ability to manipulate and manage complex data structures.

# Task 1: Restaurant Menu Update
# You are given an initial structure of a restaurant menu stored in a nested dictionary. Your task is to update this menu based on given instructions. This exercise tests your ability to manipulate nested dictionaries and manage data effectively.

# Problem Statement:
# Given the initial menu:

restaurant_menu = {
    "Starters": {"Soup": 5.99, "Bruschetta": 6.50},
    "Main Course": {"Steak": 15.99, "Salmon": 13.99},
    "Desserts": {"Cake": 4.99, "Ice Cream": 3.99}
}
# Add a new category called "Beverages" with at least two items.
restaurant_menu["Beverages"] = {"Coke": 1.99, "Tea": 1.00}
# Update the price of "Steak" to 17.99.
restaurant_menu["Main Course"] = {"Steak": 17.99, "Salmon": 13.99}
# Remove "Bruschetta" from "Starters".
del restaurant_menu["Starters"]["Bruschetta"]

print(restaurant_menu)
